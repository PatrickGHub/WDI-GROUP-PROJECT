Friday

🚡 We spent a lot of time planning, on trello, on the whiteboard, collaboratively and individually.  We wanted to ensure that we didnt miss anything and all aspects of our project would be covered by someone.

🚡 We came up with our idea relatively quickly and found a lot of APIs that we wanted to use.

🚡 We split up the tasks so that everyone knew what we aimed to have completed by Monday.

🚡 We built the basic set up to our app, downloading dependencies and creating files. We wrote a basic style sheet.

🚡 We did some pair programming to get the more complicated tasks done quicker and also worked well individually. Our team worked well because we communicated well and had a mutual respect of each other's abilities and value within the team.


The weekend

🗻 By Monday morning we had an almost working basic app. The big bug of the weekend was that, in testing we had an extra instruction to the port which was blocking the app being able to open in gulp.

🗻 Charlotte worked on test set up and authentication testing.

🗻 Patrick built the user routes.

🗻 Evelina did the user tests.


Monday

❄️ Our main API was the big blocker - we couldn’t use the one we had planned because was only in XML and we could only use it on one IP address. Patrick built the API from scratch.

❄️ We found working in a team a little challenging as we found that lots of things were half done - you couldn’t see through a whole project. We communicated a lot through slack and also took more time to explain to each other what code they had written so we could all have a better overview of where the project was and which bits of code we could build on.

❄️ Our detailed planning really helped us to prioritise MVP and communicate on what was going on and to help avoid conflicts on git - really helped that we had 3 models and 3 people


Tuesday

🏂 We reached MVP!

🏂 We had a few issues with embedding and referencing schemas. Our schemas became quite complex as different fields were needed by other schemas.  

🏂 We are proud of our auto complete function that we added to holiday index. We also used the same function in our create holiday form for attendees and destinations.

🏂 We fixed lots of smaller problems, mainly styling.  We decided to change our main hero image from a snowboarder to a gondola as we felt the snowboarder was too distracting on the page.


Wednesday

🎿 Patrick fixed yesterdays bug relating to drop down menus and embedding and referencing schemas.

🎿 Charlotte added the Google Places API.

🎿 Evelina restyled forms and battled with radio buttons. There were lots of little elements to get right here and it was important to all of us that our site looked uniform across all forms so Evelina spent some time getting this right across all form pages.

🎿 We struggled a little with having a great MVP and wanting to add too many extra features all at once. We discussed pairing back some of our plans a little.  
Extra features that we have added since MVP:
    🌨 Google Places API
    🌨 Button to favourite places
    🌨 Drop down menus
    🌨 Autocomplete forms

🎿 Designed and added favicon logo


Thursday

⛷ Patrick completed the testing phase and is delighted that everything works!

⛷ Charlotte added destination favourites to the holiday show page.

⛷ Evelina added flash messages.

⛷ We prioritised really well based on what was essential to fix and improve on and what would be a nice extra. This was much easier in a team as it was easier to stay focussed on what had to be done right away.

⛷ We had a lot of small fixes to complete.

⛷ We worked on our group presentation collaboratively.


Friday

☃️ Today was mostly tidying up small details and having to resist the urge to work on big changes.

☃️ We worked on our presentation and readme.
